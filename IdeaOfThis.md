# Coffee-Table-App
Adding Project to Git, Have an electric coffee table that's controlled by my phone and sends commands via Raspberry Pi

I made this project because i was doing some programming one day and though to myself... man i wish i had some freaking electrical outlets
on my coffee table... then it just sprialed out to making the top motorize off completely.

I had the process of it getting build and video's of it working on this url: http://rhcustoms.co.nf/?page_id=129
